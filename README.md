# are 2FA tokens truly random?

## background
`Two factor authentication` (2FA) is a widely used tool for added security in addition to a secure password. A [Time based One-time Password](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6238) (TOTP) algorithm generates a 6-8 digit code, which is shared either via SMS, email, phone, and a specialized app. Users have 30-60 seconds to receive, remember, and enter the code to login.

Either a random or pseudo-random number could be used. While a truly random number theoretically provides greater security, a pseudo-random (or non-random) number would be easier to remember. In principle, a pseudo-random number could provide a balance of security and ease of use.

An average person can hold a set of about 7 Â± 2 digits in his/her working memory at any given time. This is called the `The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two Rule` or simply [Miller's Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two). According to Miller's Rule a significant minority of people will struggle to recall a 6 digit code, and a majority will be unable to recall an 8 digit code.

Anecdotally, I have noticed that 2FA codes often exhibit patters of non-randomness (such as containing 3 more of the same digit XAAA-BBBX, repeating patterns ABAB-XXXX or ABXX-ABXX, or palindromes ABC-CBA). This is interesting, however, the human brain is highly skilled at discerning patterns, even when none actually exist. Therefore I decided to systematically analyze 2FA tokens using `Shannon Entropy` and `Kolmogorov Complexity` to see if they consistently exhibit less than expected randomness.


## approach 1

`Shannon entropy` is a measure of the information content of a string. It can be interpreted as the number of bits required to encode each character of the string given perfect compression.

If a 2FA token is truly random, we would expect it to have higher Shanon Entropy than if is was generated pseudo-randomly (or if it was non-random). We can compare the Shannon Entropy of an array of actual 2FA codes with an array that we generate randomly, using the following approach:

![2FA_entropy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48685552/230439251-1d4c4ff9-8e06-4cf2-a69f-c5576138ca71.png)

1. generate random 6 digit codes
2. calculate the shanon entropy of each
3. calcualte the mean entropy (and standard deviation) for the group of values
4. compare the two groups to determine if it is statistically likely be random

One limitation of this approach, is that Shannon entropy regards each symbol as discreet and does not account for their sequence in the alphabet. For example an obviously non-random sequence like `123456` has a Shannon entropy of 2.5849 (the highest possible for a 6 digit number). This means that Shannon entropy may not capture all the patterns of non-randomness that could be present in a 2FA code.


## results

### experiment 1 - Microsoft 2FA
I used the 35 most recent 2FA codes from my work Microsoft account and compared against 10,000 randomnly generated 6 digit codes

| Category  | n |  mean entropy | SD entropy |
| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Outlook 2FA  | 35  |2.072721 | 0.3163435 |
| Random 6-digt | 10000  | 2.124127	| 0.3102022 |

I compared these two groups using a Welch two sample t-test, and calculated `p-value = 0.4143`
Conclusion: this is not a significant difference, maybe I'm wrong.

### experiment 2 - Google 2FA
OK not to be dissuaded easily, let's try this for a different 2FA generator.

| Category  | n |  mean entropy | SD entropy |
| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Google 2FA  | 44  | 2.012759 | 0.2660723 |
| Random 6-digit | 10000  | 2.121891	| 0.3058093 |

This time I get a `p-value = 0.009521` which is suggestive that there is less than total randomness! I did some additional research on this and it turns out that [Google deliberately avoids certain strings of numbers in it 2FA app](https://www.wired.com/story/2fa-randomness/)! They presumably generate truly random sequences but 'roll the dice' again if certain hard to remember sequences are generated.

## experiment 3 - ?


# approach 2 - Kolmogorov and Levin Complexity
`Shannon Entropy` can tell us how random the numbers in a sequence are, but we need a different tool to quantify the complexity of the sequence itself.
`Kolmogorov Complexity` (or Algorithmic complexity) defines the information content of an object by shortess program capable of computing a representation of it. Thus a linear seqence (123456) would have much lower Kolmogorov Complexity than a random sequence (624315), even though these two sequences have identical Shannon entropy.

Kolmogorov complexity is calculated using the shortest algorithm that can reproduce the desired sequence. This is performed using the `Coding Theorum Method`. Practically, this is done by loading a set of algorithms and seeing which can reproduce the desired string. The longer the code required to describe the algorithm, the greater the Kolmogorov complexity.

I tried this using the `acss` package in R. This package accesses a database containing data on 4.5 million strings from length 1 to 12 simulated on TMs with 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9 symbols. Normally we would need 10 symbols for base 10, but because we are using 6-8 digit 2FA tokens we only at most 8 symbols.

As before I created a large set of truly random strings and compared their Kolmogorov complexity to strings produced as 2FA tokens.


## results

| Category  | n |  K1 | K2 |
| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Google 2FA  | 44  | 24.23574  | 5.061905e-08 |
| Random 6-digit | 1000  | 24.66229 	| 3.766267e-08 |

Comparing K1, again using a Welch T-test, I get `p-value = 0.01302`
Again this suggests that the 2FA tokens produced by google are not fully random.


## conclusion
While a small n study like this is hardly conclusive, it certainly suggests that my suspicions are right: not all 2FA tokens are not truly random. This is likely to strike a balance between security and memorability. Interestingly, this was only true for Google (not Microsoft) suggesting that some companies generate or prune 2FA codes. 


## next steps
[ ] I need to find more sets of 2FA codes, to see if other companies use pseudo-randomness
[x] Figure out how to use Kolmogorov complexity
