# are 2FA tokens truly random?

## background
Two facto authentication (2FA) is a widely used tool for added security in addition to a secure password. A [Time based One-time Password](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6238) (TOTP) algorithm generates a 6-8 digit code, which is shared either via SMS, email, phone, and a specialized app. Users have 30-60 seconds to receive, remember, and enter the code to login.

Either a random or pseudo-random number could be used. While a truly random number theoretically provides greater security, a pseudo-random (or non-random) number would be easier to remember. In principle, a pseudo-random number could provide a balance of security and be easier to remember.

An average person can hold a set of about 7 Â± 2 digits in his/her working memory at any given time. This means that a significant minority of people will struggle to recall a 6 digit code, and most will be unable to recally an 8 digit code.

Anecdotally, I have noticed that 2FA codes often exhibit patters of non-randomness (such as containing 3 more of the same digit XAAA-BBBX, repeating patterns ABAB-XXXX or ABXX-ABXX). The human brain is highly skilled at discerning patterns, even when none actually exist. Therefore I decided to analyze 2FA tokens using Shannon Entropy to see if they consistently exhibit less than expected randomness.

## approach

Shanon's entropy is a measure of the information content of a string. It can be interpreted as the number of bits required to encode each character of the string given perfect compression.

If a 2FA token is truly random, we would expect it to have higher Shanon Entropy than if is was generated pseudo-randomly (or was non-random).
